## 🚨 Found a Vulnerability? Here's What to Do

First off, **thank you!** Security researchers like you make the internet safer for everyone. Here's how we can work together:

### 🔴 Critical Rule: Don't Go Public (Yet!)

Please **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Public disclosure before a fix can put users at risk. Let's fix it first, then we can celebrate together! 🎉

### 📬 How to Reach Me (Choose Your Preferred Channel)

**Option 1: Email (Preferred for detailed reports)**
- 📧 **Email:** [sahooshuvranshusekhar@gmail.com](mailto:sahooshuvranshusekhar@gmail.com)
- 📝 **Subject:** `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - [Brief Description]`
- ⏱️ **Response Time:** Usually within 24-48 hours

**Option 2: Discord (For quick discussions)**
- 💬 **Discord:** [Its_Shuvranshu](https://discord.com/users/879695880528216075)
- 🎯 **Best For:** Urgent issues or quick clarifications
- ⚡ **Response Time:** Usually within a few hours if I'm online

### 📋 Your Report Should Include (The More Detail, The Better!)

```markdown
🔍 Vulnerability Type: [e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection, etc.]
📍 Location: [URL, file path, or component name]
💥 Impact: [What could an attacker do with this?]
🔢 Steps to Reproduce:
   1. Go to...
   2. Click on...
   3. Enter...
   4. Observe...
🎬 PoC/Screenshots: [Optional but super helpful!]
💡 Suggested Fix: [If you have ideas, share them!]
```

### ⏰ What Happens Next? (Timeline)

| Stage | Timeline | What to Expect |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| 🟢 **Acknowledgment** | Within 24-48 hours | "Got it! Looking into this..." |
| 🟡 **Investigation** | 2-5 business days | Severity assessment & validation |
| 🔴 **Fix & Deploy** | Varies by severity | See table below ⬇️ |
| ✅ **Resolution** | After deployment | Credit given (if you want!) |

**Fix Implementation Timeline:**

```
🔥 CRITICAL  → 1-3 days   (Active exploitation possible)
⚠️  HIGH     → 3-7 days   (Significant impact)
🟡 MEDIUM   → 7-14 days  (Moderate risk)
🟢 LOW      → 14-30 days (Minor issues)
```

## 🔐 What We're Doing to Stay Secure

Security isn't just about fixing bugs—it's about building things right from the start. Here's what's protecting this portfolio:

### 🌐 Frontend Fortress

```diff
+ 🔒 HTTPS Everywhere      → GitHub Pages enforces SSL/TLS
+ 🚫 No Inline Scripts     → All JS in external files
+ ✨ Input Validation      → Forms sanitize and validate
+ 🛡️ XSS Prevention       → User inputs properly escaped
+ 🌍 CORS Configured       → Only trusted origins allowed
+ 🔗 Safe External Links   → Using rel="noopener noreferrer"
⏳ CSP Headers            → Coming soon!
```

### 📦 Third-Party & Dependencies

```diff
+ ✅ Trusted CDNs Only     → No random third-party scripts
+ 🔍 Regular Audits        → Dependencies checked for vulnerabilities
+ 🚀 Minimal Footprint     → Only essential libraries included
⏳ SRI Implementation     → Subresource Integrity hashes coming
```

### 🧹 Clean Code Practices

```diff
+ 🔑 Zero Secrets in Code  → No API keys, tokens, or credentials
+ 👥 Code Review Required  → Every change gets reviewed
+ ⚖️ Least Privilege       → Minimal permissions everywhere
+ 📝 Security Logging      → Tracking unusual activity patterns
+ 🔄 Regular Updates       → Staying current with best practices
```

### 🎯 What This Site Is (And Isn't)

**✅ What We Have:**
- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript portfolio
- GitHub Pages hosting
- Client-side form validation
- External API integrations (Spotify, GitHub)

**❌ What We Don't Have (So No Worries!):**
- ~~Server-side authentication~~ (It's all static!)
- ~~Database storage~~ (No SQL injection here!)
- ~~User accounts or login~~ (Nothing to hack!)
- ~~Sensitive data storage~~ (Everything's public!)
